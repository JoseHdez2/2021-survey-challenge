- Common functionality for all services was expressed in the generic classes 
- A distinction was made between finding a score in database vs. calculating it from scratch, as this operation will become more costly for bigger databases.
- An important design decision is whether to calculate score on read (backload) or write (frontload). This will depend on the read-write ratio.
  - An environment variable determines whether to calculate on read or write, to adapt to the read-write ratios of our use cases.
- Database-level queries were used in favor of speed and scalability.
